## TDD Development Workflow

### TDD Development Workflow (MANDATORY)
- **Test-Driven Development**: All new features MUST follow TDD methodology
- **TDD Cycle**: Red (failing test) → Green (minimal code) → Refactor → Repeat
- **Before Writing Code**: Always write the test first using `npm run test:watch`
- **Component Development**: Test component behavior, inputs, outputs before implementation
- **Service Development**: Test service methods, signal updates, side effects before coding
